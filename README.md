## Overview

- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I tried a mobile first approach this time... I don't plan on going back.

### Built with

- Typescript
- HTML5
- Sass (scss)
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned how to have a navbar on desktop turn into a sidebar on mobile. Although I have used transitions in the past, this is the first time I have used them for padding and height to make the dropdowns smooth. I therefore learned something about transitions as well.

### Continued development

I notice that on desktop when I click the nav items or dropdown options in quick succession I highlight the text. In the future I should like to change all of these options into buttons.
